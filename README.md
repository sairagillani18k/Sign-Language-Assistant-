# Sign Language Assistant

Sign language is a rich and expressive form of communication used by millions of people worldwide. However, interpreting it is a challenge for most of us who are unfamiliar with it. Thanks to recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning (ML), we are now closer to overcoming these barriers and enabling more efficient communication for people with hearing difficulties.

This repository will contain my Sign Language Assistant project, which will be based upon classification and interpretation of the sign language alphabet. The sign language alphabet is a set of unique symbols that correspond to the letters of the normal English alphabet. The implemantation will focus on real-time operation.
